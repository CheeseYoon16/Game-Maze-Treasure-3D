# Game - Maze Treasure Isometric 3D
## Maze Treasure
This is a repository of a Unity Game Project that I produced during my internship as Game Designer to present my 3 months progress. 
The game objective itself is just to find a way in a maze to get to the treasure which contains the reports to be presented.
I attempted to create the game in 3D isometric since I was intrigued in the making of Minecraft.

## How to Run the Game
There's two ways to play this game
- Download file "Build.zip" and then unzip the file in your local computer
- Clone the project to your local PC and open Build/My Project.exe
