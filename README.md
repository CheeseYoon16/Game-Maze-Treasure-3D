# Game-Portfolio
Hello, welcome to my Game Design Portofolio!
This will also act like my own milestone in learning in game development world.
You can freely access the games that I designed and developed in each folder.
I mainly applied Unity to develop the game, with my basic knowledge of programming in C# and also recieved some assists for handling the annoying bugs.
I personally really enjoy the process of designing game and then developing it to be called as playable game.
For the design, I always go for any free note website such as Notion or Evernote to create a good structured game documentation, I REALLY love good structured documentation since it'll be much easier for me to track up the progress as well as for the programmers who will help me out.
I also can create some assets in Pixel using Aseprite, for now I've been able to create the animation in Aseprite and you can access the assets too in here.
I hope this portofolio will be much use or inspire anyone who opens it!
Game is a life!
